    <p>Idea flow is the name I give to the visceral sense that ideas are moving through your life at speed - you can think of it as a rate, a number of ideas per day, that create a sense of intellectual exploration and growth.</p>

<p>The greatest speeds have been achieved with dramatic amounts of reading. The experiment from Sophomore summer where I read 4 books a week is the prime example. My mind was chock full and flying each and every day.</p>

<p>Idea flow always exists, the question is how much is there and how does it feel. As a hyperanalytic addict, I find that it’s invigorating and look to maximize it (constrained optimization). I also have searched for ways to capture as much of the flow as possible and install it into habitual thought.</p>

<p>A few methods that consistently generate flow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write. Free Writing, Essays, Book Writing, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find the best online communities that I can and comment/post about topics that I care about in the space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Idea Lists. Time limited brainstorming, forcing myself to get to a high count.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read. 4 books a week was the time of greatest idea flow for me. Doing that as a lifestyle was extremely time consuming and even more rewarding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social - Meeting regularly with my smartest friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professors. They give the best worldview critiques and are great for looking up solutions and generating ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the best books and compress them into runable algorithms. Experiment based off of them and run them regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set out all of the best ideas in a field or space. Search exhaustively. And then compress the space into the strongest and most general ideas, and train thinking with that frame.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
