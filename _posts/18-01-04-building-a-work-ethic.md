Here are 10 ways you can do habitually in building your work ethic and will also enable you to be more productive.

1. Surround yourself with habitually productive people, people with an insane work ethic.
2. Create a space where the norms are what you’re working with, and do nothing else.
3. Create clarity. Know exactly what I’m working on and when. Work on projects that are unambiguous, and involve execution more than decision making.
4. Create consistency. Make progress day after day after day.
5. Have outcomes with deadlines. Know the difference between failure and success, clearly.
6. Build habits - a set of associations that enforce productive behavior.
7. Run weekly / daily goals.
8. Social accountability - bootstrap your work ethic through commitment to others.
9. Work on projects for chunks of time - eliminate excessive switching.
10. Turn down things not aligned with goals.
