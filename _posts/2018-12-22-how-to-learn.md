There are two major categories of relevant information.

One is models - a set of relationships between variables, a sense for how the system works.
The other is objects - particular techniques or behaviors that interact with models to produce learning.

For example, Focused and Diffuse thinking are models. Spaced repetition is an object/technique. Reinforcement (reward / punish) learned behavior is a model. Creating a reward is a technique.

I’m going to start this by just listing out important models and techniques, as well as unimportant models and techniques (if there’s content I think isn’t worth focusing on - a continuous list with weights on importance would be perfect, but I’ll settle for a two-tiered system for now).

Major Models:
1. Levels of abstraction - high level / low level representation of information (context vs content, bottom up learning vs. top down learning, Holistic vs. Sequential reasoning)
2. Long-term memory and working memory systems
3. Working memory limited in scope
4. Long term memory requires revisits to get content established
5. Habits as the source of most behavior
6. Cue + routine + reward + belief
7. Learning by doing as more effective than learning in abstract - 8/ learning as active or passive
9. Able to Recreate vs. Recall ability vs. Illusion of Competence
10. Outcome oriented vs. Process oriented
11. System 1 / System 2
12. Focused vs. Default Mode Thinking

Major Techniques:
1. Spaced Repetition
2. Memorable items must be repeated over several days
3. Alternate the level of abstraction you process information at, from high level context to low level details and back
4. Material as important as method. Ensure that the content being processed is sufficiently incremental and has the best 80/20 cut of the important information.
5. Modify environment
6. Eliminate distractions in the environment
7. After reading material, look away from the material and recall it. Repeat for great effect.
8. Deliberate Practice
9. Focus on the parts of content that are difficult
10. Increase intensity of practice / focus
11. Structure behavior, at least on a weekly and daily basis
12. Tutoring
13. Get into a space with experts in what you’re looking to learn
14. Pomodoro - small step towards goal, process oriented
15. Set timer to 25 minutes, cut interruptions, focus hard for 25m, give reward
16. Create abstractions / chunks by combining sets of ideas or concepts for working memory
17. Test yourself regularly on content you’re looking to learn
18. Metaphor / Analogy, Transferring mental models between fields
19. Teach someone else the content, forcing you to frame information from different perspective
20. If procrastination, focus on process instead of outcome
21. Get into a social environment that reinforces the right beliefs and values

Minor Models:
1. Understanding each step in a process vs. understanding the connection between steps
2. Learning occurs during Sleep
3. When you think of something you’d rather not do, your brain experiences pain that subsides once you actually start working on it. 4. This leads to procrastination.
5. Practice makes permanent
6. While mind is relaxing in the background, progress is made on problems
7. Attention Switching Costs / Impact of multitasking
8. Hyperbolic Discounting, default focus on short term
9. Memory has a visual / auditory component
10. Memories are not fixed, but reconsolidated every time they’re recalled
11. Memory techniques as skills in themselves requiring practice
12. Energy level / Energy management

Minor Techniques:
1. Let yourself fall into the diffuse mode while thinking about a problem (falling asleep, for example). Then wake up with an alarm or falling object and apply focused to the diffuse content.
2. Alternate the way you process information, going from focused thinking to diffuse and back to focused
3. Establish the smallest step towards working on a problem (pomodoro in general)
4. Intentionally look to dream about what you’re studying
5. Exercise regularly
6. Concept Mapping
7. Learn in different environments to avoid overfitting learning to environment
8. Promise a reward after a work session
9. Create a library of chunks / latticework of mental models
10. Overlearning (Putting in a ton of work in batch)
11. Interleaving content together to increase flexibility of understanding
12. Analyze the cue of damaging habits and avoid / change them.
13. Have a trigger-action plan when you catch yourself in the routine of a habit
14. Create an emotional reward for new habitual behavior
15. Plan quitting time on daily goals.
16. Strongly isolate work from leisure
17. Work on hard / disliked tasks as soon as you wake up, when you have willpower
18. Mnemonics / Neumonics
19. Memory Palace Technique (Link visual / spatial thinking with concepts)
20. Metaphor / analogize the concepts being learned
21. Meditation / Deep Breathing
22. Thoroughly understand the basics of content, the building blocks
23. Breaks to avoid drop in attention span over time
24. Visualization
25. Focus Tracking
26. Urge Propagation
27. 80/20 / Triage
28. Growth Mindset
29. Nutrition
30. Define study schedule
31. Goal Factor learning
