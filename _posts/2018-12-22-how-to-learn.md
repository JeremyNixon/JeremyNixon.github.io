There are two major categories of relevant information.

One is models - a set of relationships between variables, a sense for how the system works.
The other is objects - particular techniques or behaviors that interact with models to produce learning.

For example, Focused and Diffuse thinking are models. Spaced repetition is an object/technique. Reinforcement (reward / punish) learned behavior is a model. Creating a reward is a technique.

I’m going to start this by just listing out important models and techniques, as well as unimportant models and techniques (if there’s content I think isn’t worth focusing on - a continuous list with weights on importance would be perfect, but I’ll settle for a two-tiered system for now).

Major Models:
Levels of abstraction - high level / low level representation of information (context vs content, bottom up learning vs. top down learning, Holistic vs. Sequential reasoning)
Long-term memory and working memory systems
Working memory limited in scope
Long term memory requires revisits to get content established
Habits as the source of most behavior
Cue + routine + reward + belief
Learning by doing as more effective than learning in abstract - learning as active or passive
Able to Recreate vs. Recall ability vs. Illusion of Competence
Outcome oriented vs. Process oriented
System 1 / System 2
Focused vs. Default Mode Thinking

Major Techniques:
Spaced Repetition
Memorable items must be repeated over several days
Alternate the level of abstraction you process information at, from high level context to low level details and back
Material as important as method. Ensure that the content being processed is sufficiently incremental and has the best 80/20 cut of the important information.
Modify environment
Eliminate distractions in the environment
After reading material, look away from the material and recall it. Repeat for great effect.
Deliberate Practice
Focus on the parts of content that are difficult
Increase intensity of practice / focus
Structure behavior, at least on a weekly and daily basis
Tutoring
Get into a space with experts in what you’re looking to learn
Pomodoro - small step towards goal, process oriented
Set timer to 25 minutes, cut interruptions, focus hard for 25m, give reward
Create abstractions / chunks by combining sets of ideas or concepts for working memory
Test yourself regularly on content you’re looking to learn
Metaphor / Analogy, Transferring mental models between fields
Teach someone else the content, forcing you to frame information from different perspective
If procrastination, focus on process instead of outcome
Get into a social environment that reinforces the right beliefs and values

Minor Models:
Understanding each step in a process vs. understanding the connection between steps
Learning occurs during Sleep
When you think of something you’d rather not do, your brain experiences pain that subsides once you actually start working on it. This leads to procrastination.
Practice makes permanent
While mind is relaxing in the background, progress is made on problems
Attention Switching Costs / Impact of multitasking
Hyperbolic Discounting, default focus on short term
Memory has a visual / auditory component
Memories are not fixed, but reconsolidated every time they’re recalled
Memory techniques as skills in themselves requiring practice
Energy level / Energy management

Minor Techniques:
Let yourself fall into the diffuse mode while thinking about a problem (falling asleep, for example). Then wake up with an alarm or falling object and apply focused to the diffuse content.
Alternate the way you process information, going from focused thinking to diffuse and back to focused
Establish the smallest step towards working on a problem (pomodoro in general)
Intentionally look to dream about what you’re studying
Exercise regularly
Concept Mapping
Learn in different environments to avoid overfitting learning to environment
Promise a reward after a work session
Create a library of chunks / latticework of mental models
Overlearning (Putting in a ton of work in batch)
Interleaving content together to increase flexibility of understanding
Analyze the cue of damaging habits and avoid / change them.
Have a trigger-action plan when you catch yourself in the routine of a habit
Create an emotional reward for new habitual behavior
Plan quitting time on daily goals.
Strongly isolate work from leisure
Work on hard / disliked tasks as soon as you wake up, when you have willpower
MnemonicsNeumonics
Memory Palace Technique (Link visual / spatial thinking with concepts)
Metaphor / analogize the concepts being learned
Meditation / Deep Breathing
Thoroughly understand the basics of content, the building blocks
Breaks to avoid drop in attention span over time
Visualization
Focus Tracking
Urge Propagation
80/20 / Triage
Growth Mindset
Nutrition
Define study schedule
Goal Factor learning
