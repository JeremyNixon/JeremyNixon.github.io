I personally love talking about Reading as a way of life, about idea flow, and about this being my aesthetic. Let’s look at intellectual habits that can drive more productive thinking consistently.

1. Write. Post content to Facebook, Blog, Reddit, or anywhere it may be read. Make it high quality.
2. Find the best communities that you can and comment/post about topics that you care about in the space.
3. Source your writing. Tie everything together with links to all of the relevant places and integrate.
4. Read. Reading 4 books a week was the time of greatest idea flow for me. Doing that as a lifestyle seems insane - it looks something like spending 30 hours a week. But if what it’s replacing is internet reading or other forms of BS then I’m good.
5. Socialize. Meet regularly with your smartest friends and make these people into regulars and allies.
6. Visit your Professors. Visit one of your professors and get his criticism on your work or talk about ideas.
7. Put together a concrete plan for building out your worldview with focus, one step at a time. Apply the same frame every day for a week.
8. Take the best books and compress them into runnable algorithms.
9. Set out all of the best ideas in a space. Search exhaustively. 
10. Understand an author’s argument through worldview.
11. Focus on fundamentals of thinking. Take a few core principles and apply them all the time everywhere.
12. Monitor your thought. Ask yourself what it’s doing when it’s going well.
