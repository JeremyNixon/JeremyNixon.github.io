I"õ<p>Iâ€™m going to run several experiments over the ideas in this book. All of these are extremely well aligned with my worldview and goals. This is the meta-learning that matters.</p>

<p>The value of the information here is that itâ€™s low level. Itâ€™s about how to actually do deliberate practice, how to build skill in the places that matter.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Habits to Cultivate, Experiments to Run</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maximize intensity of concentration, with time limits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measuring lead metrics (inputs) instead of (or in addition to) outputs. In this case, hours spent in deep work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Selecting a location for dedicated deep work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scheduling a beginning and end time for deep work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Structuring work by consistently evaluating progress to ensure thereâ€™s no stall</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus exclusively on the wildly important things</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep a compelling scoreboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review results weekly, evaluating your performance on your lead metrics. First derivative high. Set up the next period for accomplishing goals each week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule shallow time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meditation on work while commuting, doing menial tasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grand gestures (environmental change, great investment of money or time in task)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure depth of work, work on comparative advantages (recent grad heuristic)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule every moment of your time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dedicate particular amounts of time to particular tasks</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Concepts</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate Practice approach to critical skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning is about bringing concentration to bear on your work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prevalent assembly line model of work (easy measurables dominate incentives)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of clarity/conviction, the default will be for people to do the easiest thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention paid to tiny details as part of a focus philosophy, creating quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flow states as emotionally meaningful</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our emotions come out of our attention more than our surroundings or situation. Our worldview is constructed from our attention as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of scheduling focus time, schedule shallow time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mind does not desire rest (other than in sleep), it desires change of focus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shallow work is consistently overestimated in importance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Breaks</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Snoze your break?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enforce break with concrete endtime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get into flow and donâ€™t take a break</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meditation? Meditate on what Iâ€™m going to do?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These experiments will be put into a set of behaviors initiated tomorrow. A decent bit of planning/scheduling will need to be done, and priorities set.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">My deep work plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule my time, and my blocks of deep work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure my number of hours involved in deep work daily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistently evaluate work progress</p>
  </li>
</ol>
