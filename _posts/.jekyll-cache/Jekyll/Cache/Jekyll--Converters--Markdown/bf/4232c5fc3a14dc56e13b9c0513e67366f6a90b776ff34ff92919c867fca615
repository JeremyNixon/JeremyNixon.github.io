I"—&<p>There are two major categories of relevant information.</p>

<p>One are techniques - particular techniques or behaviors that improve the quality and speed of learning.</p>

<p>The other is models - a sense for how and why a learning system works.</p>

<p>For example, long-term memory, episodic memory and working memory system are models. Spaced repetition is an object/technique. Reinforcement (reward / punish) learned behavior is a model. Creating a reward or a success scoreboard is a technique.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to start this by just listing out important models and techniques, as well as unimportant models and techniques (if thereâ€™s content I think isnâ€™t worth focusing on - a continuous list with weights on importance would be perfect, but Iâ€™ll settle for a two-tiered system for now).</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Major Techniques:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Spaced Repetition</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Memorable items must be repeated over several days</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternate the level of abstraction you process information at, from high level context to low level details and back</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Material as important as method. Ensure that the content being processed is sufficiently incremental and has the best 80/20 cut of the important information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify environment</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Eliminate distractions in the environment</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After reading material, look away from the material and recall it. Repeat for great effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate Practice</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Focus on the parts of content that are difficult</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Increase intensity of practice / focus</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Structure behavior, at least on a weekly and daily basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tutoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get into a space with experts in what youâ€™re looking to learn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pomodoro - small step towards goal, process oriented</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Set timer to 25 minutes, cut interruptions, focus hard for 25m, give reward</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create abstractions / chunks by combining sets of ideas or concepts for working memory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test yourself regularly on content youâ€™re looking to learn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metaphor / Analogy, Transferring mental models between fields</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teach someone else the content, forcing you to frame information from different perspective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If procrastination, focus on process instead of outcome</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get into a social environment that reinforces the right beliefs and values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Zone Reading: Read the text of a book and listen to its audio at 2x, simultaneously.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Major Models:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Levels of abstraction - high level / low level representation of information (context vs content, bottom up learning vs. top down learning, Holistic vs. Sequential reasoning, Conceptual vs. Concrete)</p>

  <li>
    <p>Long-term memory and working memory systems</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Working memory limited in scope</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Long term memory requires revisits to get content established</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits as the source of most behavior</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Cue + routine + reward + belief</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning by doing as more effective than learning in abstract - learning as active or passive</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Able to Recreate vs. Recall ability vs. Illusion of Competence</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome oriented vs. Process oriented</p>
  </li>

    <p>Focused vs. Default Mode Thinking</p>

</ol>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Minor Techniques:</p>

<p>This book was personally incredibly inspiring to me, describing the authorâ€™s path to mastery (world champion level) in both chess and tai chi push-hands.</p>

<p>The principles described (Internalizing Fundamentals, Beginnerâ€™s Mind, Building Your Trigger, and more) are advanced and refreshing.</p>
