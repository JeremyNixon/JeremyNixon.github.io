I"‹<p>You can see a conceptual style as the weighting over particular kinds of mental motion.</p>

<p>Recombination of weightings over mental motions creates a huge space of possible styles, but in reality it can be compressed into a few archetypes (convergent due to both mimesis and targeting similar goals)</p>

<p>Every major statistical concept can be seen as a tendency in conceptual style. Preferring linear vs. nonlinear models. Normal vs. power law distributions. Maximizing thoughtâ€™s expected value vs. variance vs. skewness vs. kurtosis. Noticing overfitting (usually due to insufficient data) and correcting. Noticing a dearth of data and gathering more. Being well calabrated about confidence (vs. not). And on and on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Associative vs. Causal thinking</li>
  <li>Empiricism vs. Rationalism
    <ul>
      <li>What empirically works vs. what should work, or what is consistent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Narrative vs. Conceptual / Analytic / Statistical</li>
  <li>Critical / Skeptical vs. Application / Building on / Recombination (Yes and)
    <ul>
      <li>Re-framing as a constructive version of the skeptical / critical mindset, which questions and replaces assumptions</li>
      <li>Working in the same direction with different assumptions, hopefully maintaining shared purpose</li>
      <li>Ontology / Paradigm Questioning (Thereâ€™s an interconnected memeplex of assumptions)</li>
      <li>Breakdown of Categories (seeing their brokenness, oneness, or decomposition)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adding Complexity (distinctions, conditionals, decomposing) vs. Compressing to Simplicity (unifying, abstracting, synthesizing)</li>
</ul>
