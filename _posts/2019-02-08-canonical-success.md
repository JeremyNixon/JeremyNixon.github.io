The mission is to assemble the traits that act as a strong filter for success, or that are strongly predictive of a canonical understanding of success. Success means different things to different people, ‘canonical success’ here points to the common understanding between people (accomplishment, status, performance, wealth) .

  

Importance ordering:

1.  Conviction / Self-Belief / Confidence
    
2.  Conscientiousness / Work Ethic / Discipline
    
3.  Sphere of Control / Responsibility
    
4.  Persistence / Determination
    
5.  Fearlessness
    
6.  Focus
    
7.  Vision
    
8.  Obsession
    
9.  Independence
    
10.  Antifragility
    
11.  Expectations
    
12.  Influence
    

  

Interactions:

-   Conviction / Self-Belief / Confidence gives you:
    

-   Sphere of Control / Responsibility (Agency narrative)
    
-   Independence (You don’t need others validation to believe)
    
-   Vision (What you think a worthy outcome needs no validation)
    

-   Obsession gives you:
    

-   Work Ethic / Discipline
    

-   Vision needs to have:
    

-   High Expectations of Outcome
    

  

How to fit in? / Borderline traits

-   Growth orientation?
    
-   Creativity?
    
-   Intelligence? (there’s a necessary threshold, but too much is dangerous)
    
-   Belief in ability to be flexible / learn what’s necessary?
    
-   Action Bias?
    
-   Resourcefulness? (Independence + Creativity + Action Bias)
    
-   Self-awareness
    
-   Self-critical (basic, not excessive)
    
-   Grounded Arrogance (Real success backing up ego) for self-efficacy
    
-   Embraces Reality / Groundedness
    
-   Agency (combination of independence / conviction / sphere of control?)
