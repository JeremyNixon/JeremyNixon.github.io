1.  Latticework of Mental Models
    

	1.  Ex., pushing [How to Think](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrrdKv267dlpy3sEVPvsRb-iZTyFKfr2mF5Wms4od3k/edit?usp=sharing) into intuition
	    

3.  Systematizing Creativity
	    

	1.  Ex., Reframing, Questioning Assumptions, Abstraction & Generalization, Decomposition, Composition / Recombination, Generators, Leading Questions, etc.
	    

5.  Filter at the Intersection of Competing Worldviews
    

	1.  Ex., [Worldview Building](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OrJDg3Y5s1g91kLsc2zVHJnZjjHbNTx8ZuHxbE20x20/edit?usp=sharing)
		    
	2.  Ex., Internalizing the conceptual style of intellectual giants
	    

7.  Intelligence Decomposition & Optimization Along All Axes
    

	1.  Memory (Working, Episodic, Long Term)
