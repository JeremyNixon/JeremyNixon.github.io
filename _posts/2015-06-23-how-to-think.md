<!-- <h2 class='post_title'>How to Think</h2>
<p> -->
Nobody that I’ve met has had a great answer to how to get a mapping from concepts and frameworks to problems to solve, where their intuition brings the most salient, information-full frameworks and concepts to mind as soon as they encounter a problem. This is definitely how my brain seems to work and so improving this would lead to great outcomes.
<!-- </p><p> -->

The plan is to run this framework against problems in life systematically, until the models become an integral part of habitual thought. System 1 can do the work of aggregating their results after I see enough data, and the framework will expose the strongest ways to think about problems immediately.
<!-- </p><p> -->

What follows is a master list of this framework.
