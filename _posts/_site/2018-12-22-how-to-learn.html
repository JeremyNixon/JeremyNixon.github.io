<p>There are two major categories of relevant information.</p>

<p>One is models - a set of relationships between variables, a sense for how the system works.
The other is objects - particular techniques or behaviors that interact with models to produce learning.</p>

<p>For example, Focused and Diffuse thinking are models. Spaced repetition is an object/technique. Reinforcement (reward / punish) learned behavior is a model. Creating a reward is a technique.</p>

<p>I’m going to start this by just listing out important models and techniques, as well as unimportant models and techniques (if there’s content I think isn’t worth focusing on - a continuous list with weights on importance would be perfect, but I’ll settle for a two-tiered system for now).</p>

<p>Major Models:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Levels of abstraction - high level / low level representation of information (context vs content, bottom up learning vs. top down learning, Holistic vs. Sequential reasoning)</li>
  <li>Long-term memory and working memory systems</li>
  <li>Working memory limited in scope</li>
  <li>Long term memory requires revisits to get content established</li>
  <li>Habits as the source of most behavior</li>
  <li>Cue + routine + reward + belief</li>
  <li>Learning by doing as more effective than learning in abstract - 8/ learning as active or passive</li>
  <li>Able to Recreate vs. Recall ability vs. Illusion of Competence</li>
  <li>Outcome oriented vs. Process oriented</li>
  <li>System 1 / System 2</li>
  <li>Focused vs. Default Mode Thinking</li>
</ol>

<p>Major Techniques:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Spaced Repetition</li>
  <li>Memorable items must be repeated over several days</li>
  <li>Alternate the level of abstraction you process information at, from high level context to low level details and back</li>
  <li>Material as important as method. Ensure that the content being processed is sufficiently incremental and has the best 80/20 cut of the important information.</li>
  <li>Modify environment</li>
  <li>Eliminate distractions in the environment</li>
  <li>After reading material, look away from the material and recall it. Repeat for great effect.</li>
  <li>Deliberate Practice</li>
  <li>Focus on the parts of content that are difficult</li>
  <li>Increase intensity of practice / focus</li>
  <li>Structure behavior, at least on a weekly and daily basis</li>
  <li>Tutoring</li>
  <li>Get into a space with experts in what you’re looking to learn</li>
  <li>Pomodoro - small step towards goal, process oriented</li>
  <li>Set timer to 25 minutes, cut interruptions, focus hard for 25m, give reward</li>
  <li>Create abstractions / chunks by combining sets of ideas or concepts for working memory</li>
  <li>Test yourself regularly on content you’re looking to learn</li>
  <li>Metaphor / Analogy, Transferring mental models between fields</li>
  <li>Teach someone else the content, forcing you to frame information from different perspective</li>
  <li>If procrastination, focus on process instead of outcome</li>
  <li>Get into a social environment that reinforces the right beliefs and values</li>
</ol>

<p>Minor Models:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understanding each step in a process vs. understanding the connection between steps</li>
  <li>Learning occurs during Sleep</li>
  <li>When you think of something you’d rather not do, your brain experiences pain that subsides once you actually start working on it. 4. This leads to procrastination.</li>
  <li>Practice makes permanent</li>
  <li>While mind is relaxing in the background, progress is made on problems</li>
  <li>Attention Switching Costs / Impact of multitasking</li>
  <li>Hyperbolic Discounting, default focus on short term</li>
  <li>Memory has a visual / auditory component</li>
  <li>Memories are not fixed, but reconsolidated every time they’re recalled</li>
  <li>Memory techniques as skills in themselves requiring practice</li>
  <li>Energy level / Energy management</li>
</ol>

<p>Minor Techniques:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Let yourself fall into the diffuse mode while thinking about a problem (falling asleep, for example). Then wake up with an alarm or falling object and apply focused to the diffuse content.</li>
  <li>Alternate the way you process information, going from focused thinking to diffuse and back to focused</li>
  <li>Establish the smallest step towards working on a problem (pomodoro in general)</li>
  <li>Intentionally look to dream about what you’re studying</li>
  <li>Exercise regularly</li>
  <li>Concept Mapping</li>
  <li>Learn in different environments to avoid overfitting learning to environment</li>
  <li>Promise a reward after a work session</li>
  <li>Create a library of chunks / latticework of mental models</li>
  <li>Overlearning (Putting in a ton of work in batch)</li>
  <li>Interleaving content together to increase flexibility of understanding</li>
  <li>Analyze the cue of damaging habits and avoid / change them.</li>
  <li>Have a trigger-action plan when you catch yourself in the routine of a habit</li>
  <li>Create an emotional reward for new habitual behavior</li>
  <li>Plan quitting time on daily goals.</li>
  <li>Strongly isolate work from leisure</li>
  <li>Work on hard / disliked tasks as soon as you wake up, when you have willpower</li>
  <li>Mnemonics / Neumonics</li>
  <li>Memory Palace Technique (Link visual / spatial thinking with concepts)</li>
  <li>Metaphor / analogize the concepts being learned</li>
  <li>Meditation / Deep Breathing</li>
  <li>Thoroughly understand the basics of content, the building blocks</li>
  <li>Breaks to avoid drop in attention span over time</li>
  <li>Visualization</li>
  <li>Focus Tracking</li>
  <li>Urge Propagation</li>
  <li>80/20 / Triage</li>
  <li>Growth Mindset</li>
  <li>Nutrition</li>
  <li>Define study schedule</li>
  <li>Goal Factor learning</li>
</ol>
