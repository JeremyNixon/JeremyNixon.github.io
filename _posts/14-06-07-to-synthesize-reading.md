1. Mandatory 3 conversations about each book you read. Describe it to the person, if necessary. Ask their thoughts about it. Have a real social experience.
2. Write a short 15 minute book reaction.
3. Keep notes while you write. Medium dependent, but ideally electronic notes on phone or laptop. I know it’s slower, but the <point is to grow from this reading, not just ‘do’ it!
4. Find a way to change your behavior in a way that will exemplify the ideas in the book. Easier with behavioral/relationship books, but a useful method.
5. Mine the book for ideas to put on your wall.
6. Find criticism and commentary of the book online. Read that to get more context. Contribute, even!
7. Find a group with interests similar to the book. Have some experience with them. Maybe even join a book club and make this a natural extension. 
8. Build something using the principles of the book. For technical stuff, build a prototype website. For fluffier things, build a website that talks about those principles in detail.
9. Read a book that gives additional context and support. Let your prior reading inform future reading. It’s a mode of rereading.
10. Reread all of the books that you truly found to be valuable. Let that value entrench itself in your life.
