I’ve noticed great speakers bamboozle by stacking major worldview breaking ideas on top of one another. This compilation can serve as high quality source material.

1. **Noble Lies (Worth Believing in Collectively, but Challenging to Defend)**
     * Equality
     * Religion
     * Free Will
     * Objective & Universal Morality / Ethics
     * Objective & Universal Meaning
     * Biological Indeterminism (Blank Slate-ism)
          * Dualism
     * Memetic Indeterminism
     * Identity / Selfhood
     * Rights
     * The One / Soulmate
     * Humans Aren’t Animals
     * Racial Biological Uniformity
2. **Solipsism - Your mind creates all that you ‘think’ is reality**
     * Nothing you engage with is anything other than your representation of it
     * Because you see reality through your mind, the world is dramatically distorted towards the possible perceptions that maximize your reproductive chances
     * Implication that creating tools that extend perception is necessary
3. **Heuristics and Biases**
     * Your mind as optimized for allowing you to believe lies that it is useful for you to live out
     * Your mind is broken
          * Confirmation Bias
          * Affect Heuristic
          * Availability
          * Anchoring
          * Risk Aversion
          * Mimetic Desire
          * You construct your experience. And your experience is evolved, and you so you are unoptimized for anything that didn’t improve the survival value of primates. Ex., the world may not be compositional, that’s merely the only way we can overwhelm the curse of dimensionality
4. **Groundlessness to all value systems**
    * Evolution of Morality & Ethics
5. **Monogamishness (Sex at Dawn style)**
6. **Counterfactual Value / Non-Marginal Impact / Replaceability**
7. **Map - Territory Distinction**
     * Conceptual Non-realism (Concepts as manifold approximations)
8. **Meta / Changing the Changers**
     * Artificial Intelligence
     * Mechanism Design
     * Creating New Values
9. **Language as an Intellectual Box**
     * Sapir-Whorf
     * Language as frame that bakes umpteen untrue assumptions into thought
     * Umpteen felt truths as unsayable
     * Wittgenstein
10. **Continuity**
     * Probability Theory as opposed to the world being binary
     * Continuum as approximated by binary or discrete thinking almost everywhere
11. **You don’t believe in anything**
12. **Existential Risk**
13. **Language Patterns - implicit frame behind what people say**
14. **Frame**
15. **Information**
    * Structure
    * Representation
    * Composition
    * Compression / Abstraction
    * Simplicity
16. **Physics**
     * Relativity (Time as observer dependent, rather than universal)
     * Quantum Mechanics
17. **Simulation & Universe Design**
     * Math / Fundamental Physics as transcendent because the creators of our universe are also subject to it or something much like it - the transcendence of that which is general across the space of possible universes
18. **Truth Optimization Invalidates all Narratives, destroys itself**
19. **IQ exists, is predictive, determines outcomes, is different between groups**
20. **Your tribe is like all other tribes.** And is using you for its own sake.
21. **Your relationship isn't special.** It's one of billions of relationships between mate and matee over time. And you're going to play out the interaction with the exact same emotions, depth of involvement and commitment as those billions before you.
22. **You don’t actually update to the things you ‘learn’**
23. **Fundamental Narratives as Fictions**
     * I am special
          * I’m loved for reasons that are specific to me
          * We are special
               1. My species (humanity) is superior to others
                    * We have traits (consciousness, life, suffering, etc.) that makes us special
               2. My tribe is superior to others
                    * I am part of something special
                    * And by association I am superior
               3. My relationship is unique
          * My life is important / significant
          * I am in the know
          * I have qualities nobody else has
          * I am the most important thing in this world (because for all of the data I’ve seen, it’s true - I am the only viscerally experiencing thing)
          * Two types - narrative that I’m special because I make myself special, or I’m intrinsically special
     * Objective Truth of their Values, Sacred Beliefs
          * Of the principles I believe in
          * I worship the true god
          * The way I measure what has value in the world
          * My version of reality is the real version of reality
               1. The narratives that I feel are fundamental to the experience had in reality
     * Everything Having a Purpose, Having a Reason
     * Victimhood Narratives
     * Villain Narratives
     * Helplessness Narratives
     * Worthlessness Narratives
     * Hopelessness Narratives
24. **Personal**
     * Twin Insemination
25. **Meaning is real as a felt sense, in the brain rather than being objective**
26. **Ethics / morality as real through an evolutionary history that created creatures constructed the way we are.** Objective in the sense that we are actually made that way, rather than objective in the sense that the map is merged with the territory
     * Kingdom / Phylum / Species level subjectivity
         * Idea list idea: identify the taxonomic level of generality of each moral impulse
27. **Great Filter**
28. **Unknown unknowns dominating**
29. **Easily accessible world domination via LAWS**
30. **Thought Loops**
    * A huge huge fraction of your thoughts are repetitive
    * Everyone has the same conversations, over and over again
    * Almost all of these repeated thoughts are useless, and could be new, creative  and valuable thoughts
