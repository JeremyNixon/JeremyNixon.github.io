1. Convince your Dean/Professor to allow you to take an intensive computer science course (Ex. Java course).
2. Take advantage of online technology school courses/tutorials (Ex. Treehouse membership - use their tutorials).
3. Find a book on coding in the science center. Then create your own project and build it. Learn, create, learn, create.
4. Find CS textbooks online, and go through them, learning the material systematically. Choose a CS final project and execute it.
5. Use Codeacademy to build skills. Direct skills to the courses you want to take at the college.
6. Research the methods used by coding camps.  Recreate the coding camp for yourself.
7. Find an online class (Coursera) and stick hard to its curriculum, Eric Schluntz style.
8. Apply to a local startup or business. Learn to code in the context of their project.
9. Take a CS class that is not the intensive course through the summer school. Learn to code in this context.
10. Use the internet to find a community of developers around your area. Use them to get ideas about starting development.
