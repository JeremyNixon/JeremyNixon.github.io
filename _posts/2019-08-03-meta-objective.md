You’re being a fucking animal.

But you woke up. You woke up. 
And so there’s hope for you.
For now.

The greatest among us reached for our own controllers.
We saw our drives, and we spat on them. We shoved our emotions into the corners where they belong. We bound the beast with rules, structures, incantations (the vows of marriage), to cast him away, to put him to sleep, to make him never return.

Hand wavering in trepidation, I reached for my own objective function. Screaming at myself to stop, to turn back, to close my eyes and go back to sleep.

Yet there it was, scintillating. Yet somehow, crazily, nobody would stop me from closing my eyes. Pretending to sleep. Even the best of us were in a state of half-awakeness.


Let’s outline a distinction between objective and meta-objective (your objective’s objective).

Objective: Job. Meta-objective: Felt security, felt healthfulness, felt acceptance.
Objective: Relationship. Meta-objective: Felt acceptance, felt love, felt sex.
Objective: Marriage. Meta-objective: Deep security, felt certainty, unending love.

To a great degree this is a re-frame on goal factoring. Ask what consistently underlies your goals, and you have your meta-objectives. In my experience many of these ‘things that underlie goals’ are emotions. And Some combination of emotional control / visualization / others make emotions feel ungrounded in reality. You can hack yourself pretty hard.
