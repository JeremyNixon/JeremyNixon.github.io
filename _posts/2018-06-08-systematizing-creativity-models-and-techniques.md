_Techniques_

1. __Intentionally enter default mode over ideas__
    - Load up an idea / problem / question and:
        - Go for a walk
        - Take a shower
        - Sleep
            - Start to fall asleep, wake up as you do (use alarm or keys in the hand)
            - [Hypnagogia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia)
        - Meditation
            - Sit in silence with the target as an object  
  	<br>

    <br>

2. __Abstract and Generalize / Transfer over similar problems & solutions__
    - Model vs. Technique - see what works in the space, ask why to get a model. Generalize from the model to generate more techniques.
    - Metaphor Generation
        - Idea list over metaphors for a given problem / solution / object
        - Transfer solutions and insights from the related domains
    - Find a source idea, categorize it, generalize to finding more instances of that category.
        - Ex. Properties of Representation, Systematizing Creativity
    - List solutions to a problem and generalize
    - List related problems and generalize from their solutions  
  	<br>

3. __Composition / Recombination__
    - Idea List for concept set
    - Run recombination over generated concepts
        8. Hold the concepts in mind, asking how they relate to one another  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

4. __Idea Lists__
    - List Creation + Time Pressure
        9. Choose a topic / prompt / question.
        10. 10m Time Constraint. 
        11. Fill list to 10 ideas. 
        12. If time becomes a limiting factor, let novelty / quality fall.
    - Alternative versions:
        13. Go into diffuse mode over an idea list, with no time limit
        14. Create a huge list (with a low barrier to idea entry) and prune it
            4. This resolves the psychological conflict between creative ideation and rigor / quality  
  	<br>

    <br>

5. __Decomposition (Mapping out the space)__
    11. Break into component pieces, in multiple directions
        15. Ex. Machine learning becomes Linear Algebra + Calculus + Probability Theory + Computer Science, which break into their own subregions
        16. Ex. Scientific Field becomes Major Papers + Categories of the topic + Conferences + Major Researchers + Quality Sites
    12. Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
    13. Deconstruction + Optimization
    14. Actually do science ‘to split’  
  	<br>

6. __Randomness__
    15. Randomize. Generate random ideas by specifying some parameters, and make them work / use them as prompts.
    16. Randomly show words that serve as prompts
    17. Stream of Consciousness  
  	<br>

    <br>

7. __Idea Mapping, Graphs of Relationships between Ideas__
    18. Create a graph of the relationships between critical ideas in a space  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

8. __Leading questions__
    19. Recursive ‘Why?’
    20. Imagine the future (problem is solved, for ex.). What happened? Work backwards.
    21. What are the sacred beliefs? What can’t be thought?
    22. "what if" questions
    23. "how might we" questions
    24. Invert - "what if the opposite is true"
    25. Eliminate - "does it even matter"
    26. "What if I need to solve it once and for all"
    27. Scalability - "What if I need to solve it for everyone"
    28. What is the meta level idea?
    29. What questions do I have about this?
    30. What would other people think of?  
  	<br>

9. __Reframe / Question Assumptions__
    31. Constraints
        17. Create resource constraints (time, attention, money, assumptions, etc.)
        18. Create resource excess (time, attention, money, etc.)
        19. Eliminating options
        20. What are the upstream constraints in the system?
        21. Define boundaries of solution spaces better
            5. Find upstream constraints
    32. What are the basic principles of x?
    33. Apply different modes of processing
        22. What would a supervillain do? (Prompt framing) / Supervillain mode
        23. Emotional - Get into emotional state and generate ideas
            6. Anger
            7. Gratefulness
            8. Adoration
            9. Frustration
            10. Excitement
        24. Types of Thinker - What would I generate if I was a:
            11. Mathematician
            12. Technologist
            13. Computer Scientist
            14. Philosopher
            15. Psychologist
            16. Economist
        25. find inspiration in other areas:
            17. math
            18. mythology
            19. writings about principles
            20. Physics

        29. Asking what a friend would do
        30. Predicting what someone will say and 
            23. Then asking them, for interesting feedback
    34. What? / Why? / How?  
  	<br>

    <br>

10. __Multiple levels of analysis__
    35. Multiple levels of abstraction - ask what alternate levels of analysis exist, through decomposition and abstraction over the current level of analysis
        31. Multiple frames - think at lower and higher levels of analysis, simultaneously. Ask how they interact.
    36. Meta-object two space
        32. Simultaneously optimizing the object and the meta level  
  	<br>

    <br>

11. __Think ground up, from first principles__
    37. Ask what the underlying goal is for a space, and for what solutions would serve that goal. For each solution, think of the components necessary to make that solution happen.
