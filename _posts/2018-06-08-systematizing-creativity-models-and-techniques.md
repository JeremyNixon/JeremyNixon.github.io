_Techniques_

1. __Intentionally enter default mode over ideas__
    - Load up an idea / problem / question and:
        - Go for a walk
        - Take a shower
        - Sleep
            - Start to fall asleep, wake up as you do (use alarm or keys in the hand)
            - [Hypnagogia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia)
        - Meditation
            - Sit in silence with the target as an object  
  	<br>

    <br>

2. __Abstract and Generalize / Transfer over similar problems & solutions__
    - Model vs. Technique - see what works in the space, ask why to get a model. Generalize from the model to generate more techniques.
    - Metaphor Generation
        - Idea list over metaphors for a given problem / solution / object
        - Transfer solutions and insights from the related domains
    - Find a source idea, categorize it, generalize to finding more instances of that category.
        - Ex. Properties of Representation, Systematizing Creativity
    - List solutions to a problem and generalize
    - List related problems and generalize from their solutions  
  	<br>

    <br>

3. __Composition / Recombination__
    - Idea List for concept set
    - Run recombination over generated concepts
        8. Hold the concepts in mind, asking how they relate to one another  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

4. __Idea Lists__
    - List Creation + Time Pressure
        - Choose a topic / prompt / question.
        - 10m Time Constraint. 
        - Fill list to 10 ideas. 
        - If time becomes a limiting factor, let novelty / quality fall.
    - Alternative versions:
        - Go into diffuse mode over an idea list, with no time limit
        - Create a huge list (with a low barrier to idea entry) and prune it
            - This resolves the psychological conflict between creative ideation and rigor / quality  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

5. __Decomposition (Mapping out the space)__
    - Break into component pieces, in multiple directions
        - Ex. Machine learning becomes Linear Algebra + Calculus + Probability Theory + Computer Science, which break into their own subregions
        - Ex. Scientific Field becomes Major Papers + Categories of the topic + Conferences + Major Researchers + Quality Sites
    - Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
    - Deconstruction + Optimization
    - Actually do science ‘to split’  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

6. __Randomness__
    - Randomize. Generate random ideas by specifying some parameters, and make them work / use them as prompts.
    - Randomly show words that serve as prompts
    - Stream of Consciousness  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

7. __Idea Mapping, Graphs of Relationships between Ideas__
    - Create a graph of the relationships between critical ideas in a space  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

8. __Leading questions__
    - Recursive ‘Why?’
    - Imagine the future (problem is solved, for ex.). What happened? Work backwards.
    - What are the sacred beliefs? What can’t be thought?
    - "what if" questions
    - "how might we" questions
    - Invert - "what if the opposite is true"
    - Eliminate - "does it even matter"
    - "What if I need to solve it once and for all"
    - Scalability - "What if I need to solve it for everyone"
    - What is the meta level idea?
    - What questions do I have about this?
    - What would other people think of?  
  	<br>

9. __Reframe / Question Assumptions__
    - Constraints
        - Create resource constraints (time, attention, money, assumptions, etc.)
        - Create resource excess (time, attention, money, etc.)
        - Eliminating options
        - What are the upstream constraints in the system?
        - Define boundaries of solution spaces better
            - Find upstream constraints
    - Apply different modes of processing
        - What would a supervillain do? (Prompt framing) / Supervillain mode
        - Emotional - Get into emotional state and generate ideas
            - Anger
            - Arousal
            - Gratefulness
            - Adoration
            - Frustration
            - Excitement
        - Types of Thinker - What would I generate if I was a:
            - Mathematician
            - Technologist
            - Computer Scientist
            - Philosopher
            - Psychologist
            - Economist
        - find inspiration in other areas:
            - math
            - mythology
            - writings about principles
            - Physics
            - Etc
        - Environmental
            - Work in a cluttered environment
        - Game Lenses, list of generic lenses
        - Asking what would Hufflepuff / Gryffindor / me would do
        - Asking what a friend would do
        - Predicting what someone will say and 
            - Then asking them, for interesting feedback
    - What? / Why? / How?  
  	<br>

    <br>

10. __Multiple levels of analysis__
    - Multiple levels of abstraction - ask what alternate levels of analysis exist, through decomposition and abstraction over the current level of analysis
        - Multiple frames - think at lower and higher levels of analysis, simultaneously. Ask how they interact.
    - Meta-object two space
        - Simultaneously optimizing the object and the meta level  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

11. __Think ground up, from first principles__
    - Ask what the underlying goal is for a space, and for what solutions would serve that goal. For each solution, think of the components necessary to make that solution happen.
        - What are the basic principles of x?
  	<br>

    <br>

12. __Automation__ [[See Expanded Version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10e4BJO_krtuSB0vI5Yo7KL98iFFeONCGZPaIFsCa8AM/edit?usp=sharing)]  
  	<br>

    <br>

13. __Thought Habits / Mental__
    - Idea List Habitually
    - Brainstorm Habitually
    - Create and refine a distinct open mode
    - Create imminent desire for coming up with relevant ideas
    - System 1 + Generalization
        - Take an intuitive response and understand its mechanism. Turn the mechanism into a generator.  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

14. __Invert__
    - Take any technique, and do the opposite over some parameter
    - Imagine ways of not doing it, or preventing the goal from being reached: adversarial  
  	<br>

    ---
    <br>

15. __Activities__
    - List Creation + Time Pressure
    - Writing
        - Write freely over the topic / question / prompt
    - Brainstorm [thought dumping]
    - Defend a difficult position, adversarial conversation
    - Drawing
    - Giving a speech to the air
    - Improv Games  
  	<br>

16. __Social Solutions__
    - Crowdsourcing ideas
    - Read Books / Articles on Topic
    - Debate the topic
    - Look up what other people have been saying about it
        - discuss things with others
        - check social media
        - find differing discussions online
        - Mapping ideas generation for other people!
    - Work with other dissimilar people
